## An analysis of the affect of metallicity on exoplanets.

The metallicity here refers to the \[Fe/H\] metallicity and is that of the host star.

Planet properties of interest include:
- Mass
- Radius
- Density

### Abstract
Many studies have aimed to identify abundance relationships and correlations between stellar metallicity and planet mass and radius for specific sizes of planets. More recently some work has attempted to compare the strength of these relationships at a discrete number of predetermined ranges, however, no undisputed studies have as yet attempted to discover the limits and turning points of these trends. In this work, the correlations between stellar metallicity and planet mass, radius and density were calculated via an MCMC analysis for a continuum of different radii, masses and densities. In this report data are presented suggesting that the effect of metallicity on a planet's mass and radius depends on the scale of the planet, with massive, large planets exhibiting a negative correlation between stellar metallicity and planet mass and radius whilst low mass, small planets exhibit a positive correlation between stellar metallicity and planet mass and radius. It is proposed that this is a result of the core dominating the mass and radius of small, low mass planets whilst the abundance of hydrogen dominates the mass and radius of larger, massive planets. No strong correlation was found for mid-sized planets.
